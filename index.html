            font-family: cursive;"> A strong nation lies in its youth who are empowered with the right values, take
                pride
                in the country and are
                able and willing to contribute for its growth and development. So Utkrisht Bharat as team aims at
                organising programmes that help in promoting nationalistic thinking and cultural ethos amongst the
                youth.

            <h1 style="text-align: center; color: red;">Culture</h1>
            <p class="culPara">India is home to over a billion people, accommodating incredible cultural diversity
                between languages,
                geographic regions, religious traditions and social stratifications. In recognition of this large
                demographic diversity, the following descriptions are not intended to represent every Indian person.
                However, there are common themes and principles that contribute to the values, attitudes, beliefs and
                norms
                of the dominant society. Generally speaking, Indians tend to have a strong sense of pride in the
                distinctiveness and diversity of their culture. For example, the country’s agricultural expansions and
                technological advancements in infrastructure, science and engineering are sources of pride. Moreover, a
                considerable amount of pride stems from India's rich artistic cultural exports of music, fine arts,
                literature and spirituality (especially the practice of yoga)

            <h1 style="text-align: center; color: red;">Nationalism</h1>
            <p class="culPara">Textbook definition of nationalism states that it is an ideology which emphasizes
                loyalty, devotion and patriotism towards a country.

                But, as Indians, Nationalism is more of an emotion than ideology. A farmer in a corner of some village
                continues to put tremendous effort in a hope that he is contributing to the Nation’s welfare. A teacher
                walks into a class full of highly energetic students thinking and working towards building the future
                generation of patriots and ideal citizens. A soldier serving his country from both inside and outside
                our perimeter readily gives his/her life so that the Nation stays protected.

                Nationalism is what brought revolutionaries of different states from Pre-Independence together.

                Nationalism is the heightened power they feel when they know they would put their Nation first any day
                and every day against all odds

        <section>
            <h1 style="text-align: center; color: red;">Governance</h1>
            <p class="culPara">Governance is all the processes of interactions be they through the laws, norms, power or
                language of an organized society over a social system. It is done by the government of a state, by a
                market, or by a network. It is the decision-making among the actors involved in a collective problem
                that leads to the creation, reinforcement, or reproduction of social norms and institutions. At
                Utkrisht Bharath, we wish to teach and give an understanding of Law, Governance and Administration to
                engineering students.
